# Startup-Sector-Predictor
Enter your innovative startup idea and instantly know what sector it belongs to in our ever-changing economic landscape!

## Goal:
To inspire you to pursue your idea by giving you a concrete idea of what sector it belongs to. This could clarify what potential laws, subisidies, grants you may have access to if you decide to push.

## The Development Process
Using the power of Generative AI, this project was developed in an hour or two with strategic oversight and conceptual understanding from my side.
